            "Susie Maskell was responsible for strategic marketing positioning and implementation 
            at Urban Pacific, a wholly owned subsidiary of Macquarie Bank Limited. From pre 
            acquisition, Susie was instrumental in ensuring the end product would meet and 
            exceed market expectations, and deliver a value proposition superior to its competitors. 
            At the same time, she has an exceptionally clear and rational approach to marketing 
            which maintains focus on shareholder value as well as customer outcomes. Susie's 
            career also includes extensive exposure to most aspects of the property industry, 
            providing excellent perspective and judgment."

            The Mandalay Project would not have been as successful in its launch were it not for the skills 
            and assistance provided by Property Marketing Solutions. Susie was integral to this project's 
            success through her knowledge of the current market and the strategies that she outlined and 
            undertook. Taking ideas from concept to completion, Susie ensured that the Mandalay project 
            was comprehensively covered throughout all aspects of the marketing.  Our marketing materials 
            have been complimented as being ‘a cut above our competitors’ and Susie has played a large 
            role in ensuring comments such as these.

            Given the importance of such a project it was re-assuring to have Property Marketing Solutions 
            on our team. I would recommend Susie and Property Marketing Solutions to any developer who is 
            seeking to ensure a successful launch of a project or a stage.
